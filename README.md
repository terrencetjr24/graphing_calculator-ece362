# Graphing Calculator Project

## Disclaimer: ##
    - The file organization is slightly disorganized
    - All relevant files can be found within src

The "src" is the folder containing all the relevant code

Within src:

    -main.c : Contains the main functional while-loop, along with several utility functions.
             The graphing function is also contained in this file
             
    -graphing.c: Contains the necessary functions for manipulating the display
    
    -parsing.c: Contains the code that parses through the inputs (recieved via button presses), and 
                calculates the output accordingly
